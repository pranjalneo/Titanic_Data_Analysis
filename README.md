# Titanic_Data_Analysis
There have been huge disasters in the history, but the magnitude of the Titanic’s disaster ranks as high as the depth it sank too. So much so that subsequent disasters have always been described as “titanic in proportion” – implying huge losses. Anyone who has read about the Titanic, know that a perfect combination of natural events and human errors led to the sinking of the Titanic on its fateful maiden journey from Southampton to New York on April 14, 1912. There have been several questions put forward to understand the cause/s of the tragedy – foremost among them is: What made it sink and even more intriguing How can a 46,000 ton ship sink to the depth of 13,000 feet in a matter of 3 hours? This is a mind boggling question indeed! There have been as many inquisitions as there have been questions raised and equally that many types of analysis methods applied to arrive at conclusions. But this project is not about analyzing why or what made the Titanic sink – it is about analyzing the data that is present about the Titanic publicly. It actually uses Hadoop MapReduce to analyze and arrive at:  The average age of the people (both male and female) who died in the tragedy using Hadoop MapReduce. How many persons survived – traveling class wise.
